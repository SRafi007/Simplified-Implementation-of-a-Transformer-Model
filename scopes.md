# Scope of Transformer Implementation

This implementation covers the basic architecture of a Transformer model, including the following key components:

1. **Positional Encoding**: Injects sequence information into token embeddings.
2. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Enables the model to focus on multiple parts of a sentence simultaneously.
3. **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: Processes attention outputs with non-linear transformations.
4. **Transformer Blocks**: Composed of multiple Transformer layers, each with attention and feed-forward components.
5. **Output Layer**: Produces logits for each token, useful in tasks like language modeling.

## Scope for Extension

- **Customization**: You can modify the dimensions (`d_model`, `hidden_dim`, etc.), the number of heads, or layers to fit specific tasks.
- **Attention Variants**: Introduce different attention mechanisms like **relative position encoding** or **multi-query attention**.
- **Pre-training**: Integrate this model with pre-trained embeddings (e.g., BERT) for better performance on specific tasks.
- **Task-Specific Layers**: Add output layers specific to tasks like **classification**, **sequence tagging**, or **machine translation**.

Feel free to modify the model for your use case and experiment with different configurations.
