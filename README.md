# Transformer Model Implementation in PyTorch

This repository contains a simplified implementation of a Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch. The Transformer architecture has revolutionized natural language processing tasks, and this project aims to help you understand the inner workings of its key components.

## Overview

The key components of a Transformer include:

- **Input Embedding Layer**: Converts tokens (words or subwords) into dense vectors.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the sequence order to the embeddings.
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously.
- **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: Applies non-linear transformations to the attention outputs.
- **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections**: Stabilizes training and improves gradient flow.
- **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions, such as start and end positions in question-answering tasks.
